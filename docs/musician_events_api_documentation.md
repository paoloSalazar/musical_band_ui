# Musician Events API Documentation

This document provides comprehensive API documentation for the musician events feature, including endpoint specifications, request/response examples, constraints, and business rules. This is intended for UI project integration.

## Overview

The musician events feature extends the existing event payment system to track individual musicians participating in events, their roles, salaries, payment statuses, and availability. It includes validation to prevent scheduling conflicts.

**Current Implementation Status**: All core features implemented and tested. Recent improvements include performance optimizations, enhanced error handling, and refined access controls for payment endpoints.

## Authentication & Authorization

All endpoints require JWT authentication via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

### Role and Permission-Based Access Control

The API uses **RoleAndPermissionChecker** for strict access control, requiring users to have BOTH the appropriate role AND the required permissions:

#### Required Roles:
- `admin`
- `musician`
- `auxiliar_musician`

#### Permissions by Feature:
- **event_musician**:
  - `read:event_musician` - View musician assignments
  - `write:event_musician` - Create/update assignments (admin only)
  - `delete:event_musician` - Delete assignments (admin only)

- **musician_availability**:
  - `read:musician_availability` - View availability schedules
  - `write:musician_availability` - Create/update availability entries
  - `delete:musician_availability` - Delete availability entries

- **musician_event_payment**:
  - `read:musician_event_payment` - View payment information
  - `write:musician_event_payment` - Create payment records (admin only)

#### Permission Assignment by Role:

**Admin Role:**
- All permissions enabled for all features

**Musician & Auxiliar Musician Roles:**
- **Musician Availability**: All permissions (`read`, `write`, `delete`)
- **Event Musician**: Read permission only (`read:event_musician`)
- **Musician Event Payment**: Read permission only (`read:musician_event_payment`)

**Feature-Specific Access:**
- **Musician Availability**: All roles (admin, musician, auxiliar_musician) have full permissions
- **Event Musician Management**: Musicians can view assignments, only admins can create/modify/delete
- **Musician Payments**: Musicians can view their payments, only admins can create payments

**Note**: This differentiated access control provides appropriate permissions based on operational needs while maintaining security.
